# Wine-Quality-Prediction
	The objective is to Predict the Quality of Wine using Naive Bayes Machine Learning Algorithm. 

# Approach
	1. First Wine Dataset is imported using sklearn module and DataFrame is made.
	2. Then the dataset is splitted into two parts: 80% for Training and 20% for Testing.
	3. Then Two Different Naive Bayes Algorithm : Gaussian and Multinomial are used to make two models.
	4. Both model are trained and score is calculated for each.
	5. Confusion Matrix is Plotted for better understanding.

# Which model is better
	In my case Gaussian Model is better with score=100% than Multiomial Model with socre=94%.
